# Stackdoku Game Rules (Legacy Note)

`docs/RULES.md` is now the single source of truth for gameplay rules.

This legacy file is retained only for historical context. Do not update gameplay behavior here without also updating `docs/RULES.md`, `README.md`, `docs/GDD.md`, and `client/src/ui/TutorialOverlay.tsx`.
